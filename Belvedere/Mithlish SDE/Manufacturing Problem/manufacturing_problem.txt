Manufacturing Problem

You are working for a manufacturing company, and are trying to make your product as cheaply as possible. Let's say you're making teddy bears. You can potentially buy painted glass eyeballs, tiny shirts, fake bear cloth, and sewing thread, and put them all together in your factory to produce the teddy bear. But to save money, maybe you can build the painted glass eyeballs yourself by buying glass and paint. And so on and so forth. You could even build your own paint if it's cheaper than purchasing paint directly! Your goal is to figure out the cheapest way to make your product. There are no costs associated with combining inputs into a product. The first part of the input will be the product you are trying to obtain (the yourself or purchasing it).

Input Description
A target product (target_product
For each Product:
- The name of the product(product_name)
- The price to purchase the product directly(price_to_purchase)
- The number of materials required as inputs to build the product ( input_product_size)
- A list of materials required as inputs to build the product (input_products)

If price_to_purchase is null,  it is impossible to purchase that product. If input_products is empty, it is impossible to build that product

These inputs will be formatted like this:
<target product>

<product_name>, <price to purchases>, <input products size), <input products> 
<product_name>, <price to purchases>, <input products size), <input products> 
<product_name>, <price to purchases>, <input products size), <input products> 
<product_name>, <price to purchases>, <input products size), <input products> 

Example

teddy bear
painted glass eyeball, 10.5,2,glass paint
glass,5,6,
Paint,4,0,
teddy bear,null,4, painted glass eyeball;tiny shirt;faux bear fur fabric;sewing thread
faux bear fur fabric,15,2,bear;yarn
bear,100,0,
yarn,2,0,
sewing thread,13,0,
tiny shirt, 24,0,

In the above example, we are making teddy bears, since that is in the first row of the input. Teddy bears are not able to be purchased on the market ("null" in the second column of the input), thus you'll have to build the teddy bear yourself.

It is cheaper to build the "painted glass eyeball" yourself out of glass and paint, instead of purchasing the eyeballs ($5 $4 < $10.5). However, it is cheaper to purchase the "faux bear fur fabric", rather than make it yourself out of bear and yam ($15 < $100 + $2). Since the list of inputs is empty for sewing threads and tiny shirts, that means they must be purchased for $13 and $24, repectively. So the cheapest price to produce teddy bears would be calculated below:

5(glass)
+ 4(paint)
+ 15 (faux bear fur fabric)
+ 24 (tiny shirt)
+ 13 (sewing thread)
------------------
$61

Notes

- The target product will always be possible to build and/or purchase
- There are no "cycles" of inputs. For example, it would never be the case that product A is an input to product 8, but product is also an put to product A
- Some products are "raw inputs", and are unable to be produced. They must be purchased. They have an empty list of out products (in the above example, bear, yarn, sewing thread, and tiny shirt are all "raw inputs")
- Since the output is simply the cheapest price to produce the target product, it dous not matter if there is a tie between the price to purchase the target product and the price to produce it.
- It is possible to for a product to be an input to multiple other products
- A list of product is in input_products, it is guaranteed to be listed as a product

Input:
• A target product
• For each Product:
The name of the product
The price to purchase the product directly
The number of products required as inputs to build the product 
A st of products required as inputs to build the product


NOTE: You have been given skeleton code to help parse this input. You may after this code a you wish, including not using it at all.
Output:
A number, formatted with two decimal places, that is the cheapest possible price to manufacture the target product
